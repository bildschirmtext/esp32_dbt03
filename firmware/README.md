This is a simple attempt at making an emulator for the old BTX modems.



  GPIO 18 -> inverting Level Shifter -> Pin ED (5)

  GPIO 19 <- inverting Level Shifter <- Pin SD (6)

  GPOI 21 <- inverting Level Shifter <- Pin S (7)

Ground is Pin E (2)

Be aware that the pinout of this sketch may be wrong and that pins 6 and 7 might be swapped.
